<p align="center"><b>An arena shooter for the Vectrex · 70 levels · 2 arenas · 4 bosses</b><br>

---

**2084. The machines built to serve us run the Arena now.** The last humans are herded inside, and the robots come
for them in waves. One fighter is left. Get the humans out, break the waves, and reach the **Overseer** - the machine
at the centre of it all. Beat it, and what is left of the robots falls back to **The Core**, the factory that builds
them. Follow them in.

Robot Arena started as a love letter to Williams' *Robotron: 2084* and Thomas Sontowski's *Robot Arena*, and grew
into a full campaign built around what the Vectrex does best: sharp, bright vectors moving fast. Every robot has its
own behaviour, every act changes the rules, and the difficulty is something you choose, not something that just
happens to you.

<sub>The cartridge board (KiCad 3D render) and the label.</sub>
</p>

* **Pure Vectrex.** The game runs on the console's own 6809 at 1.5 MHz with its 1 KB of RAM. No UVMC2, PiTrex or
  other extra hardware: it plugs into any Vectrex like a 1982 cartridge.
* **64 KB, full.** The board carries one W27C512 EPROM, a resistor and a capacitor, plus an optional DS2431 for the
  saves. The VIA's PB6 line drives A15 and switches between the two 32 KB banks. Of the 65,536 bytes, 247 are free
  (99.6 % used): there is no room for another robot, boss or arena.
* **The board:** 54 × 66 mm, two layers, gold (ENIG) edge fingers. The ROBOT ARENA title on the front and the Vectrex
  logo on the back are openings in the solder mask, so they come out in gold. The board is based on the open
  [Vectrex_Cart_PCB](https://github.com/hugonl31/Vectrex_Cart_PCB) design.

## Features

* **Two arenas, 70 levels.** Arena 1 is 37 levels in four acts. Finish it to open **Arena 2, The Core**: 33 levels
  with new robots, laser fences, power-ups and dark levels lit only by lightning.
* **Move one way, shoot another.** The four buttons fire in four directions, two neighbouring buttons fire
  diagonally, and holding a button gives autofire. All four at once sets off a bomb.
* **Twenty kinds of robot** that think differently: hunters, cowards, builders, snipers, shield bearers, mine layers,
  centipedes that split in two.
* **Four bosses**, each with phases and its own weak point.
* **Four kinds of level:** elimination, survival against the clock, swarm rings, and boss fights.
* **Three difficulties that change how robots think,** not how much they can take. On HARD they get more turns to
  act - and finishing a campaign on HARD earns a title the cartridge keeps.
* **Saves on the cartridge:** high scores, the Arena 2 unlock, the difficulty and the KING titles, on an optional
  DS2431 chip.
* **Built-in calibration** to straighten the picture of your own Vectrex.

## Gameplay

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Joystick | Move. Half a push is slow, a full push is full speed (about 3 px a frame). |
| Buttons 1 2 3 4 | Fire left, up, down, right. Two neighbouring buttons fire diagonally. |
| Hold a button | Autofire, about 7 shots a second. A fresh press fires at once. |
| Hold all four | **Bomb**: a shock wave rings out from the ship and sweeps the arena in two seconds. |

On the title, button 2 sets the difficulty (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) and button 1 opens the calibration screen. Once Arena
1 has been finished, the joystick picks **< ARENA 2 >**. A game starts with 3 ships and 1 bomb.

### The levels

* **Elimination:** destroy every robot - hulks and electrodes excepted. What is left on the clock becomes the time
  bonus. When the clock runs out you still have to finish the job, just without the bonus.
* **Survival:** stay alive until the clock runs out while robots stream in from the edges.
* **Swarm:** a ring of crosses closes in from every side. Swarm crosses take two hits.
* **Boss:** a giant robot with its own weapons and a hit bar under the clock.

Each level opens with its name and a hint while the robots wait in dotted cages. After the countdown the cages drop
and they burst out.

### Humans, ships and points

Saving humans pays in a run: 1,000 points for the first, then 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, and 5,000 for every one after
that. Losing a ship resets the run. Save every human in a level for the **savior bonus** - which is harder than it
sounds, since Hulks trample them and Brains turn them into Progs.

Anything that touches your ship destroys it, and a robot that rams you goes down with you. Extra ships come every
50,000 points on EASY, 100,000 on MEDIUM and 200,000 on HARD, up to 9. A Guardian or a Hydra drops an extra bomb.

### The campaign

**Arena 1** introduces its robots one at a time, mixes them with the ones you know, twists the rules, and ends each act
with a swarm or a boss.

| Act | Levels | |
|---|---|---|
| I · The arena awakens | 1-10 | crosses, hulks, bowties, the first swarm |
| II · The hunters | 11-20 | killers, brains, mine fields; boss: **the Guardian** |
| III · The factory | 21-30 | spheroids, quarks, tanks; the Guardian returns |
| IV · The Overseer | 31-37 | praetorians, everything at once; **the Overseer** |

**Arena 2, The Core** runs in three acts - The Foundry, The Wires, The Heart - and ends with the Hydra and the
Architect.

Finish Arena 1 on HARD to become **KING OF THE ARENA**, and Arena 2 on HARD for **KING OF THE GALAXY**. Finish on EASY
or MEDIUM and the game offers to raise the difficulty for the next run.

## The cast

Each robot's vector shape at its real size on screen, in pixels, and as it glows on the tube. Points are EASY /
MEDIUM / HARD. Anything that takes more than one hit flashes when struck and is knocked back 2 px.

### Arena 1

<p><img src="img/sketch/player.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/player.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>The fighter.</b> Fires in 8 directions: shots fly at 6 px a frame for 45 frames, at most 8 at a time. After a lost ship it returns with 2.4 s of safety, and robots near the start point are moved away.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/human.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/human.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Humans</b> wander at about 12 px a second and change direction every second or so.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/cross.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/cross.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Cross</b> · 100 / 150 / 200 · 1 hit. The foot soldier. Each one keeps its own pace, re-rolled now and then, and turns every few tenths of a second: 60 % of the time roughly toward you (exactly, or 45° off), 40 % at random.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/hulk.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/hulk.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Hulk</b> · indestructible. Plods at half a pixel a step and, three times in four, heads for the nearest human. Your shots shove it 3 px and break its plans. Only a bomb kills it, and no level requires it.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/bowtie.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/bowtie.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Small bowtie</b> · 200 / 300 / 400 · 2 hits. Alternates fast flapping and slow gliding, turns toward you half the time, and fires one aimed dot about every 3.4 s.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/strongbow.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/strongbow.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Strong bowtie</b> · 5,000 / 7,500 / 10,000 · 20 hits. Tumbles slowly. Every 1-2 s it fires a fast double shot aimed <b>where you are heading</b> - up to 32 px along your stick - plus a second on a random diagonal.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/killer.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/killer.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Killer</b> · 150 / 250 / 300 · 1 hit. Closes in diagonally on a spot beside you, each with its own offset, and <b>stays out of your four straight firing lines</b>. Fires homing arrows. Built by Spheroids.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/brain.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/brain.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Brain</b> · 500 / 750 / 1,000 · 3 hits. Hunts humans and turns them into Progs. Backs off when you come within 44 px and fires a homing missile every 4-6 s. With no humans left, it comes for you and fires more often.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/prog.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/prog.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Prog</b> · 100 / 150 / 200 · 1 hit. What a Brain makes of a human. Walks straight at you and <b>lunges at double speed</b> over the last 48 px.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/spheroid.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/spheroid.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Spheroid</b> · 1,000 / 1,500 / 2,000 · 1 hit. Zips around at 2 px a step and <b>runs</b> when you get close. Builds a Killer every 4.8 s (1.8 s in later acts), 4 of them (6 later on), then vanishes. Kill it first.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/quark.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/quark.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Quark</b> · 1,000 / 1,500 / 2,000 · 1 hit. Faster still at 3 px a step, just as shy, and builds Tanks a little more slowly than a Spheroid builds Killers.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/tank.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/tank.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Tank</b> · 200 / 300 / 400 · 5 hits. Slow, with shells <b>led toward where you are going</b>. They bounce off the walls with a random kick each time, so no two paths repeat, and last 2.4-5 s.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/layer.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/layer.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Mine layer</b> · 300 / 450 / 600 · 3 hits. Wanders, drops one of its 7 electrodes every second or so, and scuttles away from you.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/electrode.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/electrode.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Electrode</b> · 30 / 50 / 60 · 1 hit. A mine. Never moves, kills on contact, and doesn't count toward a clear.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/praetorian.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/praetorian.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Praetorian</b> · 500 / 750 / 1,000 · 4 hits. The elite guard of the late levels. Charges straight at you - faster sideways than up and down - and fires an aimed spark every 0.8 s.</p><br clear="all">

### Arena 2

<p><img src="img/sketch/splitter.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/splitter.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Splitter</b> · 150, shards 50 (EASY). Weaves toward you. Shot, it bursts into two shards that fly off sideways, turn, and home in one 45° step at a time.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/shieldbot.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/shieldbot.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Shield bot</b> · 300 / 450 / 600. Swings its shield toward you every 0.6 s. Anything within 45° of head-on bounces off; one shot in the flank kills it.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/phaser.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/phaser.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Phaser</b> · 250 / 400 / 500. Solid for 1.5-2 s, fires one led shot, then <b>phases out and reappears 64 px from you</b> - harmless and untouchable while it materialises.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/sniper.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/sniper.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Sniper</b> · 200 / 300 / 400. Takes up a position, locks an aiming line on you and fires down it a second later at 7 px a frame. It never re-aims: one step aside is enough, if you see it coming.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/orbiter.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/orbiter.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Orbiter</b> · 200 / 300 / 400. Circles you once every 2.6 s on an orbit that breathes between 64 and 22 px. It never fires. It only has to touch you.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/fence.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/fence.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Laser fence</b> · 200 / 300 / 400. Two posts and a lethal beam: on for 2.6 s, off for 1.4 s, flickering just before it fires. Some sweep across the arena. Shoot a post to break it.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/centipede.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/screen/centipede.svg" width="130" align="right"><b>Centipede</b> · 100 / 150 / 200 a segment. A head and up to 8 segments, each 7 px behind the one ahead. Hit one in the middle and the segment behind it becomes a new head: <b>two centipedes</b>.</p><br clear="all">

**Power cells:** every 15th robot destroyed in Arena 2 drops a cell that lasts 8 s - **rapid fire** (double rate,
10 s), **triple shot** (two extra shots at ±45°, 10 s) or a **shield** that takes one hit. Active powers show as cards
bottom right.

**Dark levels** show robots only within about 42 px of your ship, until lightning lights up the whole arena for an
instant.

## The bosses

<p><img src="img/sketch/guardian.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/art/card_guardian.png" width="150" align="right"><b>The Guardian</b> · levels 20 and 30 · 25,000 / 37,500 / 50,000. A hexagonal core behind <b>eight armour plates</b> of 14 hits each, then the open core: 44 hits, 50 the second time. It keeps off your firing lines and sidesteps shots that would land, while it cycles through 4-way volleys, straight and diagonal, a spawn of a homing missile, a mine and two crosses, and a <b>shield</b> that reflects your fire and regrows a lost plate. A mine drops every 2.6 s throughout.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/overseer.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/art/card_overseer.png" width="150" align="right"><b>The Overseer</b> · level 37. The mind of the Arena: six phases and 262 hits on its eye, with points for every one. It switches attack every 8 s and at each phase change, clearing the screen and leaving a mine behind: a 4-way volley, an 8-way spread, bouncing shells, crosses, homing missiles, and a faster spread. Worth 50,000 / 75,000 / 100,000. A bomb takes 10 hits off it.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/hydra.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/art/card_hydra.png" width="150" align="right"><b>The Hydra</b> · Arena 2 levels 11 and 22 · 25,000 / 37,500 / 50,000. A head dragging 5 rings, 7 the second time. <b>Only the glowing tail ring takes damage</b> - 7 hits, then the next ring glows. Everything else bounces. Strip the body and the head opens and <b>rages</b>: twice as fast, 5-way volleys, 30-36 hits to finish. The second Hydra spits shards as well.</p><br clear="all">

<p><img src="img/sketch/architect.svg" width="260" align="left"><img src="img/art/card_architect.png" width="150" align="right"><b>The Architect</b> · the final level · three phases of 40, 45 and 50 hits. It raises <b>sweeping laser fences</b> right on top of you and fires 3-way volleys. From phase 2 it teleports, returning in a ring of 8 sparks with an orbiter in tow. In phase 3 it locks an aiming line on you before a fast 3-shot burst. Worth 50,000 / 75,000 / 100,000.</p><br clear="all">

## How the robots think

* **Difficulty is thinking speed.** The game runs at 50 frames a second, but each robot gets an AI turn on only
  **70 % of the frames on EASY, 88 % on MEDIUM and 110 % on HARD**, spread evenly across them. Shots, fences and
  centipedes always move at full speed: on HARD the robots react and fire sooner, but the bullets stay fair.
* **Every level has a tier** (0-7) that raises fire rates, shot speeds, build times and missile steering, on top of
  the difficulty.
* **A shot cap** of 4 to 12 enemy shots on screen, rising with the tier, minus 2 on EASY and 1 on MEDIUM. A robot whose
  turn to fire comes while the screen is full skips it.
* **They watch your trigger.** Killers, brains, spheroids, quarks, tanks, mine layers, praetorians, splitters and
  phasers react while you hold fire: one standing in your firing line, ahead of you and within about 10 px of it,
  steps 2 px aside.
* **Homing missiles** steer every 8th frame (every 4th later on), nudging each axis 0.3 px/frame toward you up to 1.5.
  They live 4 s, so they can be outrun or tricked into overshooting.
* **Every enemy shot can be shot down,** for a few points. Losing a ship clears all enemy fire.
* **The cage burst:** for the first second after the cages open, each robot fires outward in a direction set by its
  slot. Then its own logic takes over.
* **Swarm rings** start roughly square around you. Every 4 frames each cross re-aims, and the ring accelerates over the
  first 15 seconds to almost your top speed.
* **Survival levels** bring a robot in every 1-1.4 s from a random edge: the level's featured robot three times in
  four, otherwise a cross. Spawning pauses at 30 robots on screen, and when the clock runs out everything left explodes.

---

## Under the hood

* **The cartridge:** a W27C512 EPROM with the VIA's PB6 line driving A15, giving two 32 KiB banks. Bank 1 holds the
  title, Arena 1, all the screens and the saves; bank 0 holds The Core. Banks switch only between screens. The code
  that runs during a switch - the 1-Wire driver included - sits at identical addresses in both banks, and the build
  checks those bytes, since a low PB6 also selects bank 0.
* **Saves:** an optional DS2431 1-Wire EEPROM keeps two copies of a 64-byte record, written at the end of each game
  and after calibration.
* **The frame budget:** the game holds the Vectrex's 30,000-cycle frame almost all the time. The design rule from the
  start: fewer, smarter robots rather than many dumb ones.
* **Balancing by simulation:** a bot plays every level many times in a cycle-exact emulator at three skill levels.
  Recorded human sessions were replayed against it, so the targets come from how real players actually do.
* **Calibration:** every Vectrex drifts a little at its zero reference. The calibration screen trims it, and the
  setting is saved.
